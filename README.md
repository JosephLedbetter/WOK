<h1>WÖK Fullstack</h1>

<h3> About </h3>
<p> WÖK Fullstack is a concept my personal business of outsourcing freelance front and backend developers. 
Projects involve a lot of collaboration and a team is much better than one person attempting a fullstack project
all by their lonesome. This involves collaboration input from both inside and outside developers.
